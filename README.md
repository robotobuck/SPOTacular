# SPOTacular

## Main.py
Run `main.py` to see the results of the auction. The auction finds the best way to distribute various robots across an area to survey the area. 

## RandomRobotData.py
Until real data becomes available, this simulates robots analyzing an area and rating their efficiency and ability to survey the area. For example, a submarine would have 0 ability to survey anything on land, and SPOT would have 0 utility for water, because there is a mix of water and land in most wilderness areas, the ability is on a range from 1-10. 
Efficency referes to the amount of battery the robot would use. A steep rocky area would require more battery for SPOT than it would for a flying drone to survery.
